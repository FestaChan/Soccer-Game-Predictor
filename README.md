# Soccer-Game-Predictor
"Soccer Game Predictor" is a machine learning project that uses soccer data of all the games in a specific season to predict if a team will win, draw or lose. Pandas library was used to organize and pre-process data pulled from football-data.co.uk. Scikit-learn and XGBoost libraries was used to initialize classification models: XGBoost, Support Vector Machine, and Logistic Regression. Models are deployed using flask API for user to access and make predictions. Note, this model predicts premier league games in the 20/21 season, but can be used for any league.
